# My Amazon SDE Intern Interview Experience

I recently went through the Amazon Software Development Engineer intern interview process for Summer 2025. Here's my experience.

## Application

I cold applied to Amazon through their careers portal without any referrals.

## Online Assessment

After applying, I received an invitation for the Online Assessment which had two parts:

Technical Questions: Two medium difficulty LeetCode questions

Behavioral Questions: Some behavioral alignment questions to assess cultural fit

## Interview Round

I had only one interview round that lasted about an hour.

First 20 minutes: Behavioral questions where the interviewer did a deep dive into my stories and experiences.

Remaining time: Two DSA questions:

1. A monotonic stack question with some background story
2. A standard Dynamic Programming question

I explained my complexity analysis, thought process, and approach for both problems.

## Result

Four days after the interview, I received an email saying I had cleared the interview process and was placed on the waitlist for Summer 2025 internship.

Unfortunately, I did not get the position in the end, but it was a valuable experience.

_Even though I didn't land the internship, the interview process taught me a lot about technical problem-solving and gave me insight into Amazon's hiring process._
