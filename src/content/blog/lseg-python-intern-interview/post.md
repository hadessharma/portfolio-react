# My LSEG Application Developer Intern Interview Experience

I recently went through the interview process for an Application Developer Intern role at LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), specifically for a Python-focused position. Here's my detailed experience.

## Online Assessment

The process started with an Online Assessment that was entirely Python-focused. The assessment consisted of Data Structures and Algorithms questions that had to be solved using Python specifically.

## First Round Interview

After passing the OA, I moved to the first round of interviews, which was more of a "vibe check." The interviewer focused on getting to know me better through a deep dive into my projects and resume. This round was primarily about assessing cultural fit and understanding my background.

## Final Round Interview

The final round was comprehensive and covered multiple technical areas:

### Python Basics

This section caught me off guard with some niche Python questions that I wasn't expecting:

- What happens when you add two tuples together?
- What about adding two empty tuples?

These trick questions tested deeper Python knowledge beyond typical programming concepts.

### Operating Systems Concepts

The interviewer asked about fundamental OS concepts:

- Multiprocessing vs Multithreading
- The how and why behind these concepts
- Understanding of when to use each approach

### SQL Query

I was given a sample table and had to write a SQL query to solve a specific problem. This tested my database querying skills.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

The final part included a standard DSA question, similar to what you'd find on coding platforms.

## Performance and Outcome

I was caught off guard by the niche Python trick questions, but managed to answer most questions correctly. I only struggled with 2 out of all the questions asked. The SQL and DSA portions went particularly well.

Two weeks later, I received a rejection email. While it was disheartening, the experience taught me an important lesson: I need to be more confident in my answers, especially when I know I'm correct.

## Key Takeaway

The biggest learning from this experience was about confidence during interviews. Sometimes knowing the answer isn't enough and that you also need to present it with conviction and confidence.

Despite the rejection, this interview process was valuable in highlighting areas for improvement and teaching me about the importance of confidence in technical interviews.
